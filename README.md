# Tic Tac Toe (Ad-Free Family Edition)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, originally created for my family so they could play without ads or distractions commonly found in mobile apps.

What started as a small personal project grew into a learning playground where I experimented with new concepts, game mechanics, and even turned it into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**.

## 🎯 Motivation

- Avoid ads and unnecessary permissions in mobile Tic Tac Toe apps  
- Build something fun and usable for my family  
- Practice and improve my JavaScript skills  
- Apply concepts learned from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  
- Experiment with game logic and custom features

## 🕹️ Features

### Classic Gameplay
- Standard Tic Tac Toe rules  
- Clean and simple UI  
- Runs entirely in the browser  

### Power-Ups (Custom Additions)

To make the game more interesting, I added a few custom mechanics:

- **💣 Bomb**  
  Explodes a *random row*, clearing it from the board.

- **🔀 Shuffle**  
  Randomizes the current game by shuffling all existing pieces on the board.

- **🔁 Change**  
  Swaps a random **X** position with a random **O** position.

These features were designed and implemented independently to explore game state management and randomness.

### Other additions 

- 🔊 **Sound Effects**  
  Added simple sound effects to enhance feedback for a few player actions and game events.
  
- ✨ **Visual Effects**  
  Included small visual effects to make interactions feel more responsive and engaging.
